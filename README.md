### 5. Coding Speed Analysis

**File:** [`CODING_SPEED_ANALYSIS.md`](./CODING_SPEED_ANALYSIS.md)

Research on realistic coding speeds:

- **Typing Speed:** WPM to lines-of-code conversion
- **Experience Levels:** Beginner to expert comparison
- **Context Matters:** Production vs competition vs prototyping
- **Improvement Tips:** How to code faster
- **Realistic Goals:** 1-month, 3-month, 6-month targets

**Key Data:**
- Average programmer: 40-80 lines/hour (quality code)
- Competitive programming: 200-400 lines/hour
- Thinking time: 30-70% of total time

---

### 6. Pure Typing Time

**File:** [`PURE_TYPING_TIME.md`](./PURE_TYPING_TIME.md)

Detailed analysis of actual typing time (excluding thinking):

- **WPM Conversion:** Speed to time calculations
- **Syntax Overhead:** Brackets, indentation, etc.
- **Real-world Factors:** Corrections, cursor movement
- **Scenario Analysis:** Copy-paste vs memory vs screen-reference

**Example:** 134-line program (gemni.cpp):
- 60 WPM: 18-22 minutes
- 80 WPM: 15-18 minutes
- With templates: 10-12 minutes

---

### 7. Additional Resources

**Files:**
- `CODE_TIME_ANALYSIS.md` - Specific code timing breakdown
- `YOUR_CODE_ERRORS.md` - Common algorithmic mistakes
- `COMPILE_ERROR_FIX.md` - Encoding issue solutions
